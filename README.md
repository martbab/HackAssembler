# HackAssembler

A simple implementation of assembler for Hack machine language from Nand2Tetris project https://www.nand2tetris.org/course.

The project is written in C++ using Visual Studio as I wanted to learn the language and the platform.

Sinec this is a learning project, I was not knowing what I am doing half of the time and both the layout and the code reflect this. I will be happy for any constructive feedback.
